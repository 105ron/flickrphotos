# Flickr Photos

A simple photo widget that allows you to display photos from your Flickr feed (or someone else's). I relied on a [tutorial](http://www.pixellatedvisions.com/2009/04/06/integrating-flickr-into-your-rails-website) for much of the heavy lifting.

* This project was undertaken as part of [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com), see the tutorail [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis?ref=lnav)

* This project uses the [Flickraw](http://hanklords.github.io/flickraw/) gem as `flickr_fu` no longer works with the Flickr API.
