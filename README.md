# Flickr Photos

A simple photo widget that allows you to display photos from your Flickr feed (or someone else's). I relied on a [tutorial](http://www.pixellatedvisions.com/2009/04/06/integrating-flickr-into-your-rails-website) for much of the heavy lifting. This project uses the [Flickraw](http://hanklords.github.io/flickraw/) gem as `flickr_fu` no longer works with the Flickr API.

See [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com) for more information about learning web development or for information on [this assignment](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis?ref=lc-pb).

You can view this app on Heroku [here](https://calm-coast-27204.herokuapp.com).
